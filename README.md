OO_Design_Perl
==============

Object Oriented Design Pattern implementation in Perl

OO Basics:

Abstraction

Encapsulation

Polymorphism

Inheritance


OO Principle:

Encapsulate what varies.

Favor Composition over inheritance

Program to interface, not implementation

Stirve for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete class.

Only talk to your friends.

Don't call us, we'll call you.

A class should have only one reason to change.


Don't forget, a pattern is a soluction to a problem in a context.
